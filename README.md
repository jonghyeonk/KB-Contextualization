### Knowledge-Driven Modulation of Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism for Next Activity Prediction (Preparing to submit)


This repository contains the scripts of our proposed approach of predictive process monitoring.

We split the implementation into two folders for (i) synthetic and (ii) real-logs.

For each folder, you can implement our approach by running 'run_experiments.py' file. 

You can set your own parameters on the approach in 'log_utils.py' and 'shared_variables.py files located in the folder '~\src\commons'

The output is saved in the folder '~\data\output'.

We also provide a summarized result of our experiments in 'performance.csv' file, which is presented in our paper.
