### Knowledge-Driven Modulation of Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism for Next Activity Prediction (Preparing to submit)

This repository contains developed scripts for our proposed approach of predictive process monitoring.

We split the implementation into two folders for (i) synthetic and (ii) real-logs. For each folder, you can implement our approach by running 'run_experiments.py' file. 

You can also set your own parameters in 'log_utils.py' and 'shared_variables.py files located in the folder '~\src\commons'

We also provide a summarized result of our experiments in 'performance.csv' file, which is presented in our paper. 

## Input/Output files

The used event logs and BPMN models in the paper are located in the folder '~\data\input'.

Then, after running the script, trained models and results of predictive process monitoring will be saved in the folder '~\data\output'.
